**Author:** Tarun Narang
**Repository:** [https://github.com/tarun1992/wbd](https://github.com/tarun1992/wbd)

## ## 1. Project Overview & Problem Statement

This project implements a simplified **User Journey Tracking Platform** that captures user events (page views, sessions, item interactions), stores them in a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas), and exposes APIs to retrieve analytics and user journeys.

The primary goals of the system are:

* Ingest user events at scale
* Provide user-level journey insights
* Provide aggregated analytics (e.g., top pages)
* Expose APIs for frontend visualization
* Build a simple frontend UI to demonstrate event search and analytics

# ## 3. Challenges Addressed & High-Level Approach

### **Challenge:** Track user journeys with multiple event types

**Approach:**

* Flattened event model stored in MongoDB
* Query events by userId ordered by timestamp
* Enriched metadata inside events (pageId, itemId, timeSpent)

### **Challenge:** Support scalable ingestion (~5× daily events growth)

**Approach:**

* Simple JSON-based ingestion endpoint
* MongoDB Atlas cluster which auto-scales storage
* Event data model that supports indexing on `userId` and `timestamp`

### **Challenge:** Provide analytics

**Approach:**

* Aggregation endpoints (top pages / event counts) using MongoDB aggregation pipeline

---

# ## 4. High-Level Architecture Description

The system is divided into four logical components:

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**

   * Search user journeys
   * Visualize analytics
   * Connects to backend via REST APIs

2. **Backend (Node.js + TypeScript, Express)**

   * Event ingestion
   * Analytics computation
   * User journey API
   * Connects to MongoDB Atlas

3. **Database (MongoDB Atlas)**

   * Stores events, users, articles
   * Indexed for query performance

4. **Future Cloud Layer (Not Implemented)**

   * Placeholder for AWS Lambda/API Gateway, CloudWatch, S3, EventBridge
   * README explains how it *would* be done

# ## 6. Database Design

### ### Collections Implemented

#### **1. users**

```
{
  userId: string,
  profile: { name, email, country },
  createdAt: Date
}
```

#### **2. events**

```
{
  userId: string,
  eventType: "PAGE_VIEW" | "ITEM_VIEW" | "SESSION_START" | "SESSION_END",
  metadata: { pageId?, itemId?, timeSpent? },
  timestamp: Date
}
```

#### **3. articles**

*(Used for demonstrating external system integration)*

---

## ### ERD (Text Representation)

```
User (1) ---- (N) Events
User (1) ---- (N) Sessions   [implicit via SESSION_START/END]
Articles separate, imported externally
```

---

## ### Indexing Strategy

Indexes created:

```
events: { userId: 1, timestamp: 1 }
events: { eventType: 1 }
users:  { userId: 1 }
```

These support:

* Efficient user journey queries
* Fast chronological sorting
* Fast analytics filtering

---

# ## 7. Backend / API Documentation

### ### Base URLs

Local backend runs at:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

### ### Core Endpoints Implemented

#### **1. POST /api/events**

Ingest single or batch events.

**Request:**

```json
[
  {
    "userId": "user-1",
    "eventType": "PAGE_VIEW",
    "metadata": { "pageId": "home", "timeSpent": 12 },
    "timestamp": "2025-12-06T08:00:10Z"
  }
]
```

**Response:**

```json
{ "inserted": 1 }
```

---

#### **2. GET /api/users/:userId/journey**

Returns ordered user events.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "userId": "user-1",
  "events": [
    { "eventType": "SESSION_START", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "eventType": "PAGE_VIEW", "metadata": { "pageId": "home" }, "timestamp": "..." }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **3. GET /api/analytics/top-pages**

Aggregation example.

**Response:**

```json
[
  { "pageId": "home", "count": 10 },
  { "pageId": "product", "count": 5 }
]
```

---

### **4. GET /api/health**

Simple healthcheck endpoint.

---

# ## 8. Frontend Design

### ### Views Implemented

1. **Search Page**

   * Enter `userId`
   * Navigate to Journey view

2. **User Journey Page**

   * Displays chronological events
   * Simple timeline representation

3. **Analytics Page**

   * Shows Top Pages

---

## ### User Stories

**As an analyst**,
I want to search for a user ID
So I can see all events performed by that user.

**As a product owner**,
I want to see the pages most frequently visited
So I can understand engagement.

---

## ### Screenshots

(Add screenshots here if needed — optional)

---

# ## 9. Monitoring & Dashboards

### Implemented:

* Console logging
* Error boundaries in backend

### Not Implemented (Future Work):

* AWS CloudWatch metrics
* Grafana dashboard
* S3 export logs
* Alerts / alarms

This is clearly communicated to maintain honesty.

---

# ## 10. Installation & Local Setup

### ### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* npm
* MongoDB Atlas connection string

---

### ### Setup Steps

#### **Backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in MONGO_URI
npm run dev
```

#### **Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# ## 11. Deployment Details (Honest Summary)

### **Not Implemented**

* AWS Lambda / API Gateway
* AWS S3
* AWS EventBridge
* AWS CloudWatch dashboards

### **Why:**

As a beginner in AWS, I focused on delivering complete local functionality with clear documentation and left cloud deployment as a future extension.

### **If deployed in future, the flow would be:**

```
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → MongoDB Atlas
Daily Export → Lambda → S3
Monitoring → CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms
```

---

# ## 12. CI/CD Notes

GitHub repository includes:

* `.github/workflows` folder prepared for future pipelines
* Ready structure for:

  * Linting
  * Testing
  * Deployment steps when cloud hosting is added

---

# ## 13. Design Decisions & Patterns

1. **Layered Architecture**

   * Routes → Controllers → Services → Database Models

2. **Flexible Event Model**

   * Metadata-based → easy to extend to new event types

3. **MongoDB Atlas**

   * No setup overhead
   * Scalable document model

4. **React + Vite**

   * Fast dev environment
   * Simple routing

# ## 15. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a functional, modular, and scalable user journey tracking system built with MERN-style architecture and cloud-based database.

AWS deployment & advanced monitoring remain **clear future enhancements**, but the system fulfills the logic, design, and UI requirements of the challenge.
